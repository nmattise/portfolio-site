		"Winner of 1st place in the 2015 AEC Technology Hackathon\n\nBIM software such as Revit and Archicad have been designed to generate a 3D building model, to then produce 2D [paper] drawings.\n\nOnce printed, the sections displayed in 2 dimensions might not entail all of the detail necessary to understand the building. DOC-QR is a tool that aims to visuals those sections, shown in 2D architectural drawings, as trimmed sections of the 3D Revit model, in a web browser.\n",
